# Access Transformers
A utility library for parsing and managing Access Transformers - allowing runtime manipulation of the modifier state of class files based on configuration files (access transformer files).

The format specification is in (FML Access Transformer specification)[FMLAT.md].

Many thanks to @DemonWav for invaluable assistance generating the antlr4 parser and lexer.
